# Captcha_automatic_identification
This is the final project of the course 'Advanced application of Tensorflow' with the GreekTime Tech company. Captcha is commonly used to tell computers and humans apart. In this project, we generate numerical captcha images, preprocess them, build the model and deploy the automatic identification service to the website.
